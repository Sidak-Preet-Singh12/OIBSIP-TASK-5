# OIBSIP-TASK-5
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
# Sales Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting sales based on advertising spending. The model uses linear regression to establish relationships between advertising spending on different platforms and corresponding sales values.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains the following features:

- **TV**: Advertising spending on TV
- **Radio**: Advertising spending on radio
- **Newspaper**: Advertising spending on newspaper
- **Sales**: Sales value (target variable)

The data is provided in a CSV file named `Advertising.csv`.

## Model Selection

For this sales prediction task, the Linear Regression model was chosen due to its effectiveness in predicting continuous values. The model was selected over other algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors for its ability to handle continuous target variables and produce interpretable results.

## Evaluation

The model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set. The evaluation metrics used were:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual sales values.
- **R-squared (R2)**: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

The achieved low MSE and high R-squared values indicate the model's good performance in accurately predicting sales values.

## Instructions

To use the sales prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) installed.
3. Run the `SALES_PREDICTION_USING_PYTHON.ipynb` script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. The script will display the Mean Squared Error and R-squared values as evaluation metrics.
5. You can also modify the script to load your own sales data for prediction.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook(Python 3)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
